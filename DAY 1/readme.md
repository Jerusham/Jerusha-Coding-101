Comments
Comments are very important to make the code more readable and to leave remarks in our code. Python does not run comment parts of our code. Any text starting with hash(#) in Python is a comment.

Example: Single Line Comment

    # This is the first comment
    # This is the second comment
    # Python is eating the world
Example: Multiline Comment

Triple quote can be used for multiline comment if it is not assigned to a variable

"""This is multiline comment
multiline comment takes multiple lines.
python is eating the world
"""
Data types
In Python there are several types of data types. Let us get started with the most common ones. Different data types will be covered in detail in other sections. For the time being, let us just go through the different data types and get familiar with them. You do not have to have a clear understanding now.

Number
Integer: Integer(negative, zero and positive) numbers Example: ... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 ...
Float: Decimal number Example ... -3.5, -2.25, -1.0, 0.0, 1.1, 2.2, 3.5 ...
Complex Example 1 + j, 2 + 4j
String
A collection of one or more characters under a single or double quote. If a string is more than one sentence then we use a triple quote.

Example:

'Finland'
'Python'
'I love teaching'
'I hope you are enjoying the first day of 30DaysOfPython Challenge'





Exercises:

Write strings on the python (print em). The strings are the following:
Your name
Your family name
Your country
I am enjoying 30 days of python
